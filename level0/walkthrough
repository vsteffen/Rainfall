Hello :).

In this first challenge, we disassemble the program in our home directory. We can see that it tries to call "atoi" with av[1] and checks if the value equals 0x1a7. If this is not the case, it prints "No !\n". Otherwise, it calls "execv" with "/bin/sh" and we have a shell with the effective user.
We can access to level1 flag in /home/user/level1/.pass : "1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a".
